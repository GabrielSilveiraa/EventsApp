The project's architecture is MVVM-C. The MVVM presentation pattern using Coordinators to route the app.

The app is built in Features, composed by a Coordinator and Scenes.

Every Scene is developed using the MVVM presentation architecture, along with a viewcoded layer and a service class for any network request.
